# 😎 Hi there, I’m @federicopanarotto

👨‍💻 I’m passionate about IT and love exploring new programming languages     
🌱 Currently diving deep into C#, Java, and TypeScript.  
🚀 I enjoy building fullstack applications from scratch    
🐧 My go-to Linux distro? Definitely Arch Linux    
💻 Visual Studio Code is, without a doubt, the best code editor on Earth!    

### 📚 I’m currently studying at an ITS program for fullstack web development
>I'm learning to build modern web applications using:
>- Angular and React for the frontend
>- Node.js with Express for the backend

### 🧪 Programming is so beautiful!
This is my account for school and personal learning projects  
I use this space to share what I build and experiment with
